Hi! I'm Sebastian and I'm a high school student from Sweden. I like math and I like coding. After taking a class in Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, I tried to solve some differential equations and do linear transformations with code, but it looked horrible. It was hard to graph functions. So I figured why not make an entire graphing calculator, so that I had a solid basis for which I could graph functions and do numerical approximations in the future.
