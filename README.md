Hello there!
During spring break, I have built my very own graphing calculator, I am now challenging geogebra and desmos haha!
NeLine is a graphing calculator. It can plot graps from single-variable functions, and make numerical approximations, such as estimating the area under the graph. It can also take in custom functions in code, solve ordinary zdifferential equations(1st order) and visualize linear transformations.

In all honesty, it was a lot of work, in this video I show you how to use the tool I built, that can plot single-variable functions, take in custom code, visualize linear transformations and solve 1st order differential equations.

--About Me--
Hi! I'm Sebastian and I'm a high school student from Sweden. I like math and I like coding. After taking a class in Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, I tried to solve some differential equations and do linear transformations with code, but it looked horrible. It was hard to graph functions. So I figured why not make an entire graphing calculator, so that I had a solid basis for which I could graph functions and do numerical approximations in the future.
